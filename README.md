After reading Simon Singh's 'The Code Book' I was inspired to implement my own version of the cryptanalysis techniques discussed. This project is my implementation of the various cryptanalysis techniques discussed, implemented in the programming language Rust.

This project consists of numerous small utilities rather than a singular monolith program. Each cryptography method has its own folder and within each are a number of utilities for various methods of cryptanalysis and or an implementation of the cryptography method. Their is a README.md for each cryptography method outline what it is and then a README.md for each utility if you need any further guidance on the theory or usage.
