# Cryptanalysis 

This project is my implementation of various cryptanalysis techniques against a variety of cryptography methods, implemented in the programming language Rust. After reading Simon Singh's 'The Code Book' I was inspired to implement my own version of the cryptanalysis techniques discussed.

This project consists of numerous small utilities rather than a monolith program. Each cryptography method has its own folder and within each are a number of utilities for various methods of cryptanalysis and or an implementation of the cryptography method. Their is a README.md for each cryptography method outline what it is and then a README.md for each utility if you need any further guidance on the theory or usage.
