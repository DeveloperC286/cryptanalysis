# Cryptanalysis 

This project is my implementation of various cryptanalysis techniques against a variety of cryptography methods, implemented in the programming language Rust. The inspiration to implement my own version of the  cryptanalysis techniques is from reading Simon Sighn's 'The Code Book'.

This project consists of numerous small utilities rather than a monolith program. Each cryptography method has its own folder and within each are a number of utilities for various methods of cryptanalysis and or an implementation of the cryptography method. Their is a README.md for each cryptography method outline what it is and then a README.md for each utility if you need any further guidance on the theory or usage.
